# Javascript

You'll be using Javascript to manipulate the DOM (i.e. the webpage in your browser). Examples of DOM manipulation include:

* Hiding & showing content
* Sending HTTP requsts without reloading the entire page (AJAX)
* Validating a form before submitting the data to the server
* In-browser gameplay
* Annoying popup advertisments

Javascript is a powerful language that while most commonly run inside a web browser is finding its way into other places as well. For example you can write applications for the [Arduino using Javascript](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) or write web apps on the server using [Node](http://nodejs.org/). You can also automate applications like [Adobe Illustrator with Javascript](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/illustrator/scripting.html).
